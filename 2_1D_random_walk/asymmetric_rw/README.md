# Biased vs Unbiased Random Walk: Simulation and Theory

This repository contains a Python notebook that demonstrates and compares **unbiased** and **biased one-dimensional random walks**, highlighting the emergence of **drift** due to broken symmetry in step probabilities. The results are validated against exact analytical predictions from probability theory and statistical physics.

---

## 📌 Overview

A random walk is one of the simplest stochastic processes and serves as a foundational model for:
- Brownian motion
- Diffusion processes
- Transport phenomena
- Drift–diffusion dynamics

In this notebook, we study:
- **Unbiased random walk**: equal probability of stepping left or right  
- **Biased random walk**: unequal step probabilities, leading to systematic drift

We compute and compare:
- Mean position as a function of time
- Simulation results vs analytical expressions

## 🔬 Physical Model

### 1D Lattice Random Walk

At each discrete time step, a particle moves:
- Right by \( +1 \) with probability \( p \)
- Left by \( -1 \) with probability \( q = 1 - p \)

Let \( x_N \) be the position after \( N \) steps.

---

## 📐 Analytical Results

### Mean Displacement

The expected displacement after \( N \) steps is

\[
\langle x_N \rangle = (p - q) N = (2p - 1)N
\]

---

### Unbiased Random Walk (\( p = 0.5 \))

\[
\langle x_N \rangle = 0
\]

- No preferred direction
- No drift
- Motion is purely diffusive

---

### Biased Random Walk (\( p \neq 0.5 \))

\[
\langle x_N \rangle = v N
\quad \text{with} \quad
v = 2p - 1
\]

- Symmetry is broken
- A finite **drift velocity** emerges
- Mean position grows linearly with time

---

## 🧪 Simulation Details

- Large ensemble of independent random walkers
- Discrete time evolution
- Mean position computed by averaging over realizations
- Comparison with analytical predictions

The notebook visualizes:
- Simulated mean position
- Exact analytical mean for both cases

---

## 📊 Key Results

- **Unbiased walk**:  
  Mean position fluctuates around zero, confirming the absence of drift.

- **Biased walk**:  
  Mean position grows linearly with time.  
  The slope of the curve gives the drift velocity:
  \[
  v_{\text{sim}} \approx v_{\text{theory}} = 2p - 1
  \]

The simulation and analytical curves show excellent agreement, validating the theoretical description.

## 🧠 Physical Interpretation

- The unbiased walk models **pure diffusion**, where fluctuations grow but the average position remains fixed.
- The biased walk models **drift–diffusion**, relevant to:
  - Charged particles in an electric field
  - Molecular transport under external forces
  - Nonequilibrium stochastic processes

The linear growth of the mean position is a direct manifestation of **broken detailed balance**.
